# aligator.dev

This is the source of my website [aligator.dev](https://aligator.dev).  
It is built using just typescript, html and css. No React, no Vue, no jquery, no etc.

I also experiment a bit with Golang to webassembly a bit. That's why it is possible to run
[GoSlice](https://github.com/aligator/goslice) in your browser. Just call `goslice gopher.stl`

## commands
As the website consists of just a virtual terminal, you can just type `help`.
